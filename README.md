# rock-paper-scissors

This is a JavaScript exercise that I've developed following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).

It does pretty much what it's supposed to do: Deliver countless rounds of fun playing "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the RNG.

For instructions, look up on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors).
